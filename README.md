A Java text-based project that helps you do several things with/to matrices, i.e. 2D arrays made of numbers:


- Add two matrices? Check!

- Multiply each cell of a matrix by an integer? Check!

- Multiply two matrices? Check!

- Transpose AKA flip (main diagonal of | side diagonal of | vertically | horizontally) a matrix? Check!

- Find the determinant of a matrix with the help of recursion? Check!

- Find the inverse of a matrix? Check!

Example of input and output:

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix to a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit

Your choice: > 6

Enter matrix size: > 3 3

Enter matrix:

> 2 -1 0
> 0 1 2
> 1 1 0

The result is:

 0.33   0  0.33
-0.33   0  0.66
 0.16 0.5 -0.33
